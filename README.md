#Here is my forecast.

Democrats will take the House. Looking at FiveThirtyEight they give the Democrats a 87% chance to win and that seems pretty high to me so im going with that. In their one graphic it seems like there is alot of solid D states, therefore the House seems very likely to swing Democratic.For the House I see a 226-209 Democratic victory. 

However, for the Senate I see that the Republicans will win. I see Texas and and Tennessee being two very important states to win with Republicans the favorite to win both. Texas does love their Ted Cruz so I don't see him losing in Texas. Im seeing a 52-48 Rupublican win here folks.
