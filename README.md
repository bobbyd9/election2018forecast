#Here is my forecast.

Democrats will take the House. Looking at FiveThirtyEight they give the Democrats a 87% chance to win and that seems pretty high to me so im going with that. In their one graphic it seems like there is alot of solid D states therefore, the House seems very likely to swing Democratic.

However, for the Senate I see that the Republicans will win. I see Texas and and Tennessee being two very important states to win with Republicans the favorite to win both. Im seeing a 52-48 Rupublican win here folks.
